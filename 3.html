<p>(2) Technical specifications: express the level of
   performance of the individual units, and are
   subdivided into (a) individual unit specifications
    which state boundaries (parameters) of the unit's
     performance consisting of a nominal
     (desired or mandated) value and tolerance
     (allowable departure from the nominal value,
     (b) acceptable quality level which states limits
     that are to be satisfied by most of the units,
     but a certain percentage of the units is allowed
      to exceed those limits, and
      (c) distribution specifications which define an
       acceptable statistical distribution
       (in terms of mean deviation and standard Deviation)
        for each unit, and are used by a producer to
         monitor its production processes. See also standard.
